chrome-shazam2spotify
=====================

Chrome extension used to export your Shazam tags to a Spotify playlist

This branch is just an experiment. I tried to have an app and an extension to handle Shazam login/parsing/fetching.

In fact, we would need a separate app and extension if we want this to work (as we need the cookies from MyShazam, and packaged apps don't have access to browser cookies).

It's better to have just one extension to install, so this branch is abandonned for now.
